<h1>Overall Progress</h1>
<h2>Project 2</h2>
Project 2 was a very fun yet challenging project due to the fact that we had to learn how to use azure and a lot of new visual studio concepts but overall satisfying to use</br>
This project took the longest to complete in my case</br>
<h2>Project 3</h2>
Project 3 was very interesting because we had to make our own Web API which was challenging but not to the lengths of project 2</br>
<h2>Project 4</h2>
Project 4 was by most the one that was fun and very satisfying to see in action, it felt very revolutionary and fun. I enjoyed it the most enjoyable overall</br>
The use of UI path software was very simple to understand</br>
<h2>Project 5</h2>
I found POWER BI interesting but not fun to use I was confused at the begginning but once you understand it, it is quite easy to understand</br>
